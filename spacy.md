# SpaCy

* SpaCy is another powerful NLP tool that is easily used to create production-ready apps. It's pretty well-known for its pipelines, which are easy to use and robust to deploy.&#x20;
* SpaCy is also useful for building transformer-based pipelines, which allow data scientists and MLEs to run SOTA models.&#x20;
* They have a lot of cool transformer-based models and pipelines, such as:&#x20;
  * `en_core_web_trf`&#x20;
  * `en_core_web_lg`
  * `spaCy RoBERTa (2020)`
  * `Flair`

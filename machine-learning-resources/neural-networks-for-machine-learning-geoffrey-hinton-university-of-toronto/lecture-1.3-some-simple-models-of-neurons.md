## Idealized Neurons&#x20;

* To model things we have to idealize them (i.e. atoms)&#x20;
  * we need to make simplifications to show how these might work&#x20;
  * idealization removes the complicated details that are not essential for understanding the main principles&#x20;
  * when we understand the basic principles, it's easier to add complexity
* It is often worth understanding models that are known to be wrong (but we must not forget that they're wrong)&#x20;

## What is Machine Learning?

* The machine learning approach:&#x20;
  * instead of writing a program by hand for each specific task, collect a lot of examples and specify the correct output given an input
  * an ML algorithm takes these examples and produces a program that does the job
  * massive amounts of computation are now cheaper than paying someone to write a task specific program&#x20;
* Tasks solved by learning:&#x20;
  * pattern recognition
  * recognizing anomalies
  * prediction

## A Standard Example of Machine Learning

* genetics and fruit flies <-> MNIST database for handwritten digits&#x20;
* ImageNet Task: 1000 different object classes in 1.3 million high-resolution training images from the web
* The speech recognition task
  * Pre-Processing
  * The acoustic model
  * Decoding

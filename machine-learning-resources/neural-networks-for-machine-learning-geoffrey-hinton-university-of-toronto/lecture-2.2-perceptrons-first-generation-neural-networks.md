* investigated in the early 1960s, but fell into disfavor for a time because of their limitations

## The standard paradigm for statistical pattern recognition&#x20;

1. Convert the raw input vector into a vector of feature activations&#x20;
   * Use handwritten programs based on common sense to define the features
2. Learn how to weight each of the feature activations to get a single scalar quantity
